[todoapp.webm](https://github.com/yasarzeynep/UpSchool-FullStack-Development-Bootcamp/assets/116646963/8f774d07-574b-4d6a-a0bf-9a9cb412942f)

## Requirements for this assignment;
- Develop a single-page todo application using React/TypeScript and Semantic UI framework.
- Our todos will be listed in a list format under the heading "Todos".
- There should be a "Add" button and a text input next to or above the heading. This button should be active if there is a value in the text input, allowing the user to add a new todo.
- When double-clicked on a todo, the isCompleted value should be updated. For example, if isCompleted is false, it should be set to true, and if it is true, it should be set to false.
