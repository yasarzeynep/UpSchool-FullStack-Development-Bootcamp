 ##  HM 3: UpStorage-CQRS Design Pattern
 Requirements for this assignment;
 - The fields in the "Address", "Note", "NoteCategory" entities must be configured correctly for the database.
 - A User can have more than one Address. (one-to-many)
 - A Note can be in more than one Category, and it can be assigned to more than one Note in a Category. (many-to-many)
 - For "Address" Add, Update, Delete and HardDelete Commands must be created in the "CQRS" structure.
 ```
 Commands; 
 - Add
 - Update
 - Delete
 - HardDelete
 
```
 - GetById and GetAll Query must be created in the "CQRS" structure for "Address".
 
  ```
 Query; 
 - GetById
 - GetAll
```
