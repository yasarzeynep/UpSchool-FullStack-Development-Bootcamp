 ##  HM 2: Password Generator-Undo Button
 
In this assignment, the goal is to add an undo button feature to improve the user experience in Password Generator.

### Requirements

- Users should be able to retrieve all the passwords they have created after the application has started, up to the first password by using the undo button.
For example: If the first password created when the page is first opened is "m0x21k", the user should be able to go back to the "m0x21k" password by using the "undo" button after creating 20 more passwords.

- If there is no password that can be retrieved in order to be able to retrieve it (for example, we are in the part where we created the first password or we have recovered everything until the first password.) then the “undo” button should be grayed out and unclickable (deactivate).
